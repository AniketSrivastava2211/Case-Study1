## Process

**Deliverable:Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data**

Using RStudio is a prudent decision for this analysis, given the large size of the dataset and the need for efficient data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

### Step 1: Setting up the environment and importing the data

To begin the data cleaning and analysis process in RStudio, we need to install and load the necessary packages. We'll be using the following packages:

*tidyverse:* A collection of packages that provide essential data manipulation and visualization functions.

*lubridate:* For working with date and time data.

*ggplot2:* A powerful package for creating visualizations.

*dplyr*: For data wrangling and transformation.

*readr:* For reading CSV files and handling data import.

```{r install packages, results = "hold", message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Install packages 
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("skimr") #for viewing and evaluating the data
install.packages("ggplot2") #for visualizations
install.packages("geosphere")
```

```{r load packages, results = "hold", message = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(skimr)
library(geosphere)
```

### Step 2: Importing the Data

In this step, we will efficiently import the 12 CSV files into RStudio and seamlessly merge them into a unified data frame, simplifying the data manipulation process for our analysis.

Importing the Data for each month:

```{r import data, results = "hold"}
#Import Data

july_2022 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/july2022.csv")
august_2022 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/aug2022.csv")
september_2022 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/sept2022.csv")
october_2022 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/oct2022.csv")
november_2022 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/nov2022.csv")
december_2022 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/dec2022.csv")
january_2023 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/jan2023.csv")
february_2023 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/feb2023.csv")
march_2023 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/march2023.csv")
april_2023 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/april2023.csv")
may_2023 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/may2023.csv")
june_2023 <- read.csv("~/RStudio/Project1/XLS 2022-23/june2023.csv")

```
To ensure that each dataset has exactly the same column names, we can use the *colnames()* function in R to check the column names for each dataset. If the column names match across all datasets, it indicates that they have consistent structure and can be combined into a single data frame seamlessly.

```{r check colnames, results='hide'}
#Checking Column Names

colnames(july_2022)
colnames(august_2022)
colnames(september_2022)
colnames(october_2022)
colnames(november_2022)
colnames(december_2022)
colnames(january_2023)
colnames(february_2023)
colnames(march_2023)
colnames(april_2023)
colnames(may_2023)
colnames(june_2023)
```


To combine all 12 months of datasets into a single data frame, we can use the *bind_rows()* function from the dplyr package. This function concatenates data frames by rows, effectively merging them into one unified data frame.

```{r combine datasets}
yearly_data <- bind_rows(july_2022, august_2022, september_2022,october_2022,november_2022,
                         december_2022,january_2023,february_2023,march_2023, april_2023,
                         may_2023,june_2023)
```


The dataset under review presents an issue where the date and time columns are in character format by default. As a result, before proceeding with data analysis, we must convert these two columns into the appropriate date-time(POSIXct) format. This conversion ensures accurate temporal analysis and enables us to leverage date-related functionalities in R for a comprehensive and reliable examination of the data.

```{r Converting data type into date-time format}
#Converting the data type of columns started_at and ended_at to DateTime Format
clean_data <- yearly_data %>%
  mutate(started_at = as.POSIXct(started_at, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
         ended_at = as.POSIXct(ended_at, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
```


To verify whether our data has been successfully combined, we can use the skimr package to generate a comprehensive summary of the merged dataset. This summary will provide valuable insights into the structure and content of the combined data, ensuring that the merging process was successful and facilitating further analysis.

```{r overview_of_yearly_data, echo=TRUE}
#Check Combined Data
skim_without_charts(clean_data)


```

#### Data Summary


The dataset contains 5,382,546 rows and 13 columns, giving us a comprehensive understanding of its dimensions and structure.
Moreover, we noticed some columns with missing values:

start_station_name: 857,860 missing values
start_station_id: 857,992 missing values
end_station_name: 915,655 missing values
end_station_id: 915,796 missing values
end_lat: 5,795 missing values
end_lng: 5,795 missing values

Additionally, we identified discrepancies in the start_lng and end_lng columns. The majority of the data corresponds to Chicago, but some entries have a value of 0, which seems to be erroneous.

It's essential to address these missing values and errors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our dataset for further analysis.

### Step 3: Cleaning the Data

Following a thorough review of our combined dataset's data summary, it has become apparent that some data cleaning is necessary. There are missing values in certain columns, and we've identified potential errors in others.

To ensure the integrity and reliability of our data, we are taking the proactive step of initiating a data cleaning process. By addressing missing values and correcting any inaccuracies or anomalies, we aim to create a more robust and trustworthy dataset for our analysis and future use.

#### Checking the time duration of trips and adding a column to the data

```{r time duration of trips}

clean_data1 <- clean_data %>%
  mutate(trip_duration_minutes = as.numeric(difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "mins")))

```

#### Step 3.1: Removing the empty values from the data

In this data cleaning process, we remove empty (whitespace-only) values from the "station name" and "station ID" columns. This ensures a more reliable dataset for analysis.

```{r removing null values}
#Removing empty values from the station name and id columns

library(stringr)

clean_data1 <- clean_data1 %>%
  filter(
    !(str_trim(start_station_name) == "" | 
        str_trim(start_station_id) == "" | 
        str_trim(end_station_name) == "" | 
        str_trim(end_station_id) == "")
  )
```

We check the cleaned data once-

```{r}

skim_without_charts(clean_data1)
```

#### Step 3.2: Removing the null values, and the incorrect geographical coordinates from the data

In this data cleaning process, we eliminate null values and incorrect geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) from the dataset.

```{r}
clean_data2 <- clean_data1 %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(end_lat) & !is.na(end_lng) &
      is.numeric(end_lat) & is.numeric(end_lng) &
      end_lat >= -90 & end_lat <= 90 &    # Latitude ranges from -90 to 90 degrees
      end_lng >= -180 & end_lng <= 180   # Longitude ranges from -180 to 180 degrees
  )
  
```

We check the cleaned data once-

```{r}

skim_without_charts(clean_data2)
```

#### Step 3.3: Removing the negative trip durations from the data

In the summarized data, we observe negative trip durations, which are illogical and should be removed from the dataset to ensure data cleanliness.

In addition to removing negative trip durations, we also notice that some trip durations in the data exceed 24 hours, which is implausible. To maintain data integrity and ensure meaningful analysis, we will remove these trips with durations exceeding 24 hours.

```{r}

#Removing the negative trip durations 

clean_data3 <- clean_data2 %>%
  filter(trip_duration_minutes > 0 & trip_duration_minutes <= 1440) 

```




#### Step 3.4 Data Transformation-

Let's explore how we can effectively transform the data to analyze how annual members and casual riders utilize the company's bikes differently. We can derive the following metrics from the initial dataset:

Step 1: Ride Duration in Minutes
Calculate the duration of customer bike rides in minutes by finding the time difference between the 'started_at' and 'ended_at' columns.

Step 2: Ride Distance in Meters
Assess the distance covered by customers during their bike rides using the 'geosphere' package's 'distHaversine' function, which calculates distance based on start and end geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).

Step 3: Time of Day Usage
Extract the hour at which each bike trip started to identify peak usage times during the day.

Step 4: Days of the Week Usage
Record the day of the week on which each bike ride started to analyze weekly patterns.

Step 5: Monthly Usage
Note the specific month when each bike trip commenced to understand monthly trends in bike usage.

Step 6: Additional Columns for Aggregation
Add two new columns, 'start_day' and 'start_month', to facilitate data aggregation.

Step 7: Renaming 'member_casual' Column
For clarity, rename the 'member_casual' column to 'customer_type'.


Assuming your data is stored in a data frame named clean_data3, we will proceed with each step:

```{r}
#Transformation of the data


clean_data4 <- clean_data3 %>%
  mutate(
    ride_distance_meters = distHaversine(
      cbind(start_lng, start_lat),
      cbind(end_lng, end_lat)
    ),
    start_hour = hour(started_at),
    day_of_week = wday(started_at, label = TRUE),
    month = month(started_at, label = TRUE),
    start_day = day(started_at),
    start_month = month(started_at, label = TRUE),
    weekday = ifelse(weekdays(started_at) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), FALSE, TRUE)
  ) %>%
  rename(customer_type = member_casual)
```

We also remove the negative trip distances from our data-

```{r}
#Removing the negative trip  distances

clean_data4 <- clean_data4 %>%
 filter(trip_duration_minutes > 0 & ride_distance_meters > 0)

```

By following these steps, we can conduct a comprehensive analysis to uncover meaningful distinctions in bike usage between annual members and casual riders. These insights will enable us to better understand customer preferences and behaviors, aiding decision-making and improving services accordingly.

## Analyse

**Deliverable:A summary of the analysis**

In the analysis step, we will explore and analyze the transformed data to gain insights into how annual members and casual riders utilize the company's bikes differently. 

### Step 1: Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate summary statistics for the numerical columns related to ride duration, ride distance, and other relevant metrics for both annual members and casual riders. Use functions like summary(), mean(), median(), etc.

```{r}
# Summary Statistics for Cleaned Data
clean_data_summary <- summary(clean_data4$trip_duration_minutes)
print("Summary Statistics for Overall Trip Duration:")
print(clean_data_summary)

# Summary Statistics for Casual Riders Trip Duration
casual_riders_summary <- summary((filter(clean_data4, customer_type == "casual")$trip_duration_minutes))
print("Summary Statistics for Casual Riders Trip Duration:")
print(casual_riders_summary)

# Summary Statistics for Member Riders Trip Duration
member_riders_summary <- summary((filter(clean_data4, customer_type == "member")$trip_duration_minutes))
print("Summary Statistics for Member Riders Trip Duration:")
print(member_riders_summary)
```

Additionally, we compute the total trip duration for each type of customer: casual riders and member riders. This information provides us with a holistic view of the combined time spent by both customer groups using the company's bikes-

```{r}
# Calculate Total Trip Duration for Casual Riders
total_trip_duration_casual <- sum(filter(clean_data4, customer_type == "casual")$trip_duration_minutes)

# Calculate Total Trip Duration for Member Riders
total_trip_duration_member <- sum(filter(clean_data4, customer_type == "member")$trip_duration_minutes)

# Print the Results
print("Total Trip Duration for Casual Riders (in minutes):")
print(total_trip_duration_casual)

print("Total Trip Duration for Member Riders (in minutes):")
print(total_trip_duration_member)
```
In the descriptive analysis, we observed the following key points:

Trip Duration: The overall trip duration ranges from 0 to 1439.37 minutes, with an average of approximately 15.99 minutes.

Casual Riders: Their trip duration ranges from 0 to 1439.37 minutes, with an average of approximately 22.37 minutes, indicating longer rides on average.

Member Riders: Their trip duration ranges from 0 to 1436.33 minutes, with an average of approximately 12.09 minutes, suggesting shorter and more frequent trips.

Outliers: We noticed some trip durations of 0 and nearly 1440 minutes, which could be data errors or outliers.

Total Trip Duration: We calculated the total trip duration for both casual and member riders, providing insights into their overall usage patterns. Casual riders have a higher total trip duration compared to member riders.

This initial analysis helps us understand customer behavior and usage patterns, revealing potential areas for further exploration and insights.

### Step 2: Visualization:


To gain deeper insights and explore the patterns in our data, we utilize visualizations through various graphs such as histograms, box plots, and bar charts. These visualizations offer an intuitive representation of key metrics and behaviors related to bike rides. By employing the ggplot2 package for data visualization, we can create informative graphs that help us better understand the dataset.

Our visualizations focus on the following aspects:

* **Usage Patterns by Hour:** We will create a bar chart to visualize the hourly usage patterns of the bikes. This will help us identify peak hours when customers use the service the most.

```{r}
# Visualization of Usage Patterns by Hour
ggplot(clean_data4, aes(x = start_hour, fill = customer_type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Usage Patterns by Hour",
       x = "Hour of the Day",
       y = "Number of Rides",
       fill = "Customer Type")
```
<br>
* **Usage Patterns by Day of the Week:** We will use another bar chart to visualize the number of rides on each day of the week. This will allow us to observe trends and differences in bike usage between weekdays and weekends.

```{r}
# Visualization of Usage Patterns by Day of the Week
ggplot(clean_data4, aes(x = day_of_week, fill = customer_type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Usage Patterns by Day of the Week",
       x = "Day of the Week",
       y = "Number of Rides",
       fill = "Customer Type")

```
<br>
* **Usage Patterns by Month:** A bar chart will also display bike rides by month, revealing seasonal trends and variations in customer behavior.

```{r}
# Visualization of Usage Patterns by Month
ggplot(clean_data4, aes(x = month, fill = customer_type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Usage Patterns by Month",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Number of Rides",
       fill = "Customer Type")
```
<br>

Through these visualizations, we aim to present a comprehensive and clear analysis of how annual members and casual riders use our bike-sharing service differently. The insights derived from the visualizations will support data-driven decision-making, leading to improvements in customer experience and operational efficiency.

### Step 3: Comparison of Ride Count between Annual Members and Casual Riders

```{r}
# Set custom labels for weekday facet
weekday_label <- c("Weekend", "Weekday")
names(weekday_label) <- c("FALSE", "TRUE")

# create a graph for comparison
clean_data4 %>%
  group_by(customer_type, weekday) %>%
  summarize(number_of_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = customer_type, y = number_of_rides, fill = customer_type)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~weekday, labeller = labeller(weekday = weekday_label)) +
  labs(title = "Number of Riders for Each Membership",
       x = "Membership Type",
       y = "Number of Rides") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Casual Rider", "Cyclistic Member")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, margin = margin(t = 20)),
        legend.position = "none") +
  geom_text(aes(label = number_of_rides, vjust = 1.5))
```
<br>

This comparison sheds light on the distinct riding behaviors of these customer groups, helping us understand their preferences and trends. Such insights can guide service improvements and cater to the specific needs of each customer category.

### Step 4: Average Trip Duration Every Hour by Day of the Week

In this section, we visualize the average trip duration every hour for each customer type (casual and member) across different days of the week.

```{r}
# Group the data by customer_type, day_of_week, and start_hour, and calculate the average trip duration
average_duration_data <- clean_data4 %>%
  group_by(customer_type, day_of_week, start_hour) %>%
  summarize(average_duration_minutes = mean(trip_duration_minutes))

# Create a line plot to visualize the average duration over hours for each day of the week
ggplot(average_duration_data, aes(x = start_hour, y = average_duration_minutes, color = customer_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ day_of_week, ncol = 3, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Average Trip Duration Every Hour by Day of the Week",
       x = "Hour of the Day",
       y = "Average Trip Duration (minutes)",
       color = "Customer Type") +
  theme_minimal()
```
